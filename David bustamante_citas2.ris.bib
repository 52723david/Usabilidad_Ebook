abstract = {The objective of designing and evaluating visual display terminals for usability is to enable users to achieve goals and meet needs in a particular context of use. ISO 9241-11 explains the benefits of measuring usability in terms of user performance and satisfaction. These are measured by the extent to which the intended goals of use are achieved, the resources that have to be expended to achieve the intended goals, and the extent to which the user finds the use of the product acceptable. ISO 9241-11 emphasizes that visual display terminal usability is dependent on the context of use and that the level of usability achieved will depend on the specific circumstances in which a product is used. The context of use consists of the users, tasks, equipment (hardware, software and materials), and the physical and social environments which may all influence the usability of a product in a work system. Measures of user performance and satisfaction assess the overall work system, and, when a product is the focus of concern, these measures provide information about the usability of that product in the particular context of use provided by the rest of the work system. The effects of changes in other components of the work system, such as the amount of user training, or the improvement of the lighting, can also be measured by user performance and satisfaction. The term usability is sometimes used to refer more narrowly to the attributes of a product which make it easier to use (see Annex D). Requirements and recommendations relating to the attributes of the hardware, software and environment which contribute to visual display terminal usability, and the ergonomic principles underlying them, are provided in other parts of ISO 9241.},

abstract = {The objective of designing and evaluating systems, products and services for usability is to enable users to achieve goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction taking account of the context of use. This document explains how usability can be considered in terms of user performance and satisfaction and emphasizes that usability is dependent on the specific circumstances in which a system, product or service is used. This document explains in detail how to interpret each component in the definition of usability: the extent to which a system, product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. NOTE 1 In this document, usability relates to the outcome of interacting with a system, product or service. Usability as defined in this document is not an attribute of a product, although appropriate product attributes can contribute to the product being usable in a particular context of use. NOTE 2 Usability is a more comprehensive concept than is commonly understood by "ease-of-use" or "user friendliness".},

Usability as defined in this document is not an attribute of a product, although appropriate product attributes can contribute to the product being usable in a particular context of use.

NOTE 2 Usability is a more comprehensive concept than is commonly understood by "ease-of-use" or "user friendliness".

Usability is relevant to:
— Regular on going use, to enable users to achieve their goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction.
— Learning, to enable new users to be become effective, efficient and satisfied when starting to use a system, product or service.
— Infrequent use, to enable users to be effective, efficient and satisfied, with the system on each reuse.
— Use by people with the widest range of capabilities.
— Minimise the likelihood and the undesirable consequences of use errors.
— Maintenance, to enable maintenance tasks to be completed effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction.

Usability can be considered for interactions with a system, product or service for the purposes of:
— development;
— procurement;
— review or comparison; and
— marketing and market research.},
